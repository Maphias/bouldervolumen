Hey,

this is a small script to generate the plates required for assembeling a bouldering volume. 
This is done by triangulation, thus adjacent plates with 0Â° taper angle should be merged together. I have not yet done this

However the skript works for now and generates plates for cutting out as svg files. There is also an animaion to show which 
shape is created.
